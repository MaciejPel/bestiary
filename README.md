# Overview
Very first iteration of storageBox project (web app mostly for storing images). It's build with Express and Mongoose on backend (I was also experimenting with storage on Google Drive and Imgur, but both were a poor choice) and React with Typescript on frontend. I've decide to do a complete rewrite into NextJS because of lack of type safety, Mongoose & Javascript problems and slow Material UI autocomplete experience. 

## Status
Abandoned.
